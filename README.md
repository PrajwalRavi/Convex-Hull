# Convex Hull
* This repo contains implementation of Jarvis march, Graham scan and Kirk Patrick Seidel algorithm in C++14.
* convex.cpp has been implemented as an API, enabling usage by importing into other programs easily.
* main.cpp is a driver program.
* GUI for KPS shows final output, while that for others shows intermediate steps also.
* Many tests and test generators are present in the folder - tests. This includes tests in which all points lie on the convex hull - ideal for comparing running times.

## Usage

1. Input from **inp.txt** and output to **out.txt**.
2. Follow sample input format.
3. Compile your program using **g++ -g <file_name>** and run using **./a.out > out.txt < inp.txt**.
4. Run python file to plot
